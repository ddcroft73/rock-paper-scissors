# Rock Paper Scissors

A very simple implementation of RPS. I really struggled with the layout. I am learning CSS, and flexbox rather quicky and I'm sure best practices are being overlooked but I'm satisfied with my rate of progress. I can think of a better way that I should have made this app, but only after looking at others solutions. I'm challenged when it comes to designing GUIs and tend to well overthink it. I wanted the layout to be responsive and it is... although I should have tried a bit harder. I tend to get hung up on the asthetics. I have 0 desire to do front end work however with the help of TOP, I do feel I am gaining the tools I need. Beginning to get familiar with JS and so far I like it almost as much as Python, not as much as C#, however I do plan to do all my backend in Python, but will learn the correct way to use node.js.  Used a derivative of a solution I came up with that employs a dictionary in python. Used a JSON for the solution. I didn't spend a lot of time at first on the code but I feel like it's a lot cleaner than it was, but I'm never totally happy with anything.
