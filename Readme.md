# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a WIP because I'm Ok with the CSS and HTML(OK being the operative word here. I get it, somewhat but honestly loathe anything GUI.), but JS is seriously messing with me. I'm used to python and I find JS along the same lines of easy, however it really has some screwy behavior. For example. I cant split a string and then manipulate the results without an error. I'd stack this into a one liner for something as trivial as get_filename() but can't seem to stack code like I can in Python. It's probably just that i have yet to learn the "tricks" I didnt even take a tutorial i just started coding from what i read in TOP and searched howto's on SO and w3Schools. ALl I'm tryiny to do is grab the file name from a path without the extension, and I see that there are similiar methods, split(), join(), slice(), but they are different and I need more time. Also, My code is super spaghetti. I got sidetracked and just wanted to finish it. Was trying to be clever with a solution for RPS (One I used a year ago) and I can't recall it to save my life, so i just threw the program together.
