# Rock Paper Scissors

A very simple implementation of RPS. I really struggled with the layout. I amd learning CSS, and flexbox rather quicky and Im sure best practices are being overlooked but I'm satisfied with my rate of progress. I can think of a better way that i should have made this app, but only after looking at others solutions. I'm challenged when it comes to designing GUIs and tend to well overthink it. I wanted the layout to be responsive and it is although I should have tried a bit harder. I tend to get hung on the asthetics. I have 0 desire to do front end work however with THe help of TOP, I do feel I am gaining the tools I need. Beginning to get familiar with JS and so far I like it almost as much as Python, not as much as C#, however I do plan to do all my backend in Python, but will learn the correct way to use node.js.  My code for this is embarrasing, not well thought out but I didnt need to , or didnt feel I needed to plan for this logic. Icame up with a really clever solution for pyhton a good while back and decided to use a derivative of that. But the structure of the program is all over the place and the logic is not well thought out. It works weel from the tests I've ran. It's just a matter of comfort at this point and I'm becomming more adept at python, still with a ways to go.
